# News-Finder_web
A Python-based RSS news scraper that continuously collects articles from popular news outlets (BBC, Times of India, NDTV, and The Hindu). The app parses RSS feeds, fetches full article content (paragraphs without attributes), and stores everything in a local JSON file while avoiding duplicates.
